# 🧠 Architecture

UI Layer → Handles application interface (Panels, Frames)  
DAO Layer → Database operations  
Model Layer → Data structures  
DB Layer → Database connection management  
Utility Layer → UI helpers and theme configuration  

This architecture improves:

- Code readability
- Maintainability
- Separation of concerns
